## Just finished my first lesson for Ruby on CodeAcademy!
puts "Hello World, this is calculating 16/9 as"
print "  "
puts 16 / 9
print "but that is a poor estimation of 1.618"
puts

variable_string = "I guess I have a string a ding."
variable_numero_uno = 867.5309
variable_boolean = false

print variable_numero_uno
print " is good for the soul, and apparently "
puts variable_string

print variable_boolean
